# ID2209_final_project

Project Objective : 

The main goal of this project is to create a simulation to demonstrate the behavior and interactions between different types of agents with distinct behaviors, personal traits, and preferences. 

The simulation involves at least 50 agents, and includes at least two different types of places where the agents can interact. (Stage, Stores, Toilets) . 

The project involves monitoring a global value (such as happiness) and displays this value on a graph to draw conclusions about the impact of different behaviors on the value. 

Finally, the project makes use of agent communication through FIPA for long distance messaging.
